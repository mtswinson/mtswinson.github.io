        	<p> In the Fall of 2019, a team of three individuals and myself developed a data storage and employee management tool: resulting in a streamlined scheduling process for a local hospital. Through a custom-built user interface, hospital personnel were provided with an intuitive application to assign nurses and doctors to incoming patients; while simultaneously updating local patient records. This project not only strengthened my coding abilities and knowledge of backend arrays, it fostered my ambitions to work alongside a cohesive team of like-minded developers

        	<p> Assisted Academic professionals in the gathering and analysis of information regarding Bitcoin's past, present, and future impact on the global economy. Through the information gathered and database analysis conducted, a research article produced by Valdosta State University's Dr. Jin Wang is set to reach publication in late 2020.

        	<p> With an underlying interest in video game development, my undergraduate capstone project tested my knowledge of creative game design. Using Three.JS, HTML, and JavaScript, a multi-level adventure game was crafted; with updates and patch notes being presented to cohort members on a weekly basis. In addition to the problem-solving skills gleaned, undertaking this assignment improved my ability to communicate complex concepts, meet tight deadlines, implement visual studios, and utilize GitHub repositories.
